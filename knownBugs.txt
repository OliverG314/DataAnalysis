Known bugs:

- Exponential extrapolation still not perfect [FIXED - 0.1.2]
- Equation label resetting position when regression menu opened
- Extrapolating when annotations are shown removes annotations [FIXED - 0.2.1]
- Exponential regression only work for data that fits e^x, not e^-x, (-e)^x, or (-e)^-x
- Polynomial regression goes kinda funky after exponentially regressing
- When entering new data, label positions aren't saved
- Exponential regression is plain broke. Works a bit better in 0.3.0 but can fit more data in 0.4.0 (sort of)
- Extrapolating without a plot throws an error
